*There is an improveent in my typing speed as well as in learning and remembring tags .

*Its easy and intersting to code and the joy I feel after completing my project is just awesome .

*Difficult part is I don't read the requirement asked but just start the coding and tries to make the same file as asked. Due to this reason only I skipped this .txt file.. ;-)
